## Testing


## Bugs or Issues
1. Command parsing - 
   * Running into an infinite loop
2. Winning and losing condition clarity - 
3. Separation of classes based upon the use-case of the game
   * Coming up with the states of those classes and behaviours affecting the state.

## Extensions
I implemented the following three extensions:

1. "Directions as verbs" Feature


2. "Winning and losing condition" Feature


3. "drop" verb
